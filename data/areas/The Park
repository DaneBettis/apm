description | Trees encircle a large clearing of short cut grass that slopes gently down
toward a pond sitting in the middle of the clearing. The branches of the
trees reach out in vain trying to cover the sky about the peaceful
sanctuary. In the middle of the pond there is a tiny island with several
benches that visitors use to relax or feed the ducks. A bridge can also be
seen connecting the small island to the eastern bank of the pond.~

before a cave. Tall grass and bushes surround a semicircle of solid rock on
the ground. The cave appears to be nothing more than a large rock sitting
atop another with a gap between the two. Enormous trees loom over the
clearing and cave as if trying to hide it from the outside world.~

description | Below this bridge crystal clear water rests calmly, with only the occasional
ripple disturbing the surface of the pond. The bridge itself is made of
finely sanded wood stained a dark red, and is wide enough to let a few
people stand side by side. Handrails made of the same red stained wood run
on either side of the bridge, offering support and safety for those
crossing. To the west is a small island upon which several stone benches
sit. To the east a dirt path leads off into the trees.~
