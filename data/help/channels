{Wsay / ooc / quote / emote{x <argument>
     This will print the <argument> on the specified channel.

Says and emotes can only be seen by other players in the same room.
Says are something your charcter communicates verbally. Emotes are
actions your character does physically.

Oocs and quotes are global channels and can be heard by all players
currently on the MUD that have the channels turned on.

You can toggle a channel off and on by typing the channel name with
no argument.~
