Elves live in the great forest, Mystic Woods An enchanted place said to
hold many great secrets and magical beings. The elves call this place home
living in the tops of the great trees. Elves are a magical race being bery
attuned to the mystic arts. They are highly intelligent and agile and can
not be found in a forest unless they wish to be. Their society is based
around nobility. Elves can be a hard people to understand as they are a
moody people and noone really understands what the elves find offensive and
what they like. In fact most people think elves find all things offensive
except other elves and magic. Elves and Mazreki are mortal enemies. The
elves view the Mazreki as being abominations and would love nothing more
than to see the species wiped from the earth. Elves stand about 5'5" to
6'0". They have gold, blue, green, or violet eyes. Their hair is either
white, blonde, or a lightly hued blue. They are a wonderful source of
magical knowledge, if one can get them to talk with them.~
