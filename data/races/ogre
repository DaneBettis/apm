name | ogre~
description | Ogres are the brutes of the evil races. Large, strong, and stubborn they
don't hesitate to use force, in fact it is the first thing they do in any
situation. They are often used as bodyguards and physcial labor, and not
always by their choice, by powerful magical races like the Mazreki. The ogre
society is based on strength, of course, the strongest leads and must defend
is place in the hierarchy on a regular basis. Ogres dwell in tribes on the
western plains of Akrios, although they do have a city of sorts located in
the southern plains where the strongest and smartest chieftains rules. Ogres
stand 7'5" to 9'0". Their eyes are brown, blue, or green. Their hair is
white, black, or brown. Their skin color ranges from pale to dark brown.
Most evil races are weary when traveling with them, but prefer to take their
chances with them rather than against them.~
