name | goblin~
description | Goblins are wicked and untrustworthy race. They are deceitful creatures that
would stab themselves in their own back if it were possible. Goblins dwell
within the Dread Marshes, an area of swamp land that is full of pitfalls and
deathtraps. The Dread Marshes were once said to be beautiful lush plains,
until a powerful mage came to the land. He was a sadistic and cruel man by
the name of Kaza'Dar, erecting a tower from which he performed an untold
number of magical experiments. Through his magic he changed the earth about
his tower into the Dread Marhes and created the hateful little race known as
goblins to serve as his guardians. That was thousands of years ago, but
rumors say the human mage still dwells deep within the marshes in a tower of
obsidian rock. The goblins, the only ones that probably know the truth,
never speak of the mage and in truth will deny ever knowing about such a
man. Goblins being far from truthful are a poor source of information. This
race can be called chaotic at best. They have no real social structure and
only reside in large groups for convienance. They have a cruel sense of
humor with someone's death being the ultimate laugh. They are a short race,
slender but strong for their size. They are stealthy and quick and are
resistant to all kinds of poison, which is probably because they use the
stuff so often. Goblins are fierce fighters that do anything to win. They
stand about 4'5" to 5'5". They have green, brown, or yellowish skin. Their
eyes are black with white pupils. Their hair color ranges from black, brown,
green, and yellow. They are not trusted by any race, although some evil
races such as the Mazreki do employ them for their abilities quite often.~
