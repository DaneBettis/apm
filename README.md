Another Python MUD
===

An example of a MUD server in Python.  I played and worked on some code for old MUDs
mostly MERC/DIKU/ROM based back in the mid '90s so you will see some design similarities
as I based features I wanted on ones I had seen before.  There are some new features
I haven't seen in any other MUD, however I do not keep up on current MUD development
so I may be 'reinventing the wheel' to an extent.  This is primarily a tinkering tool
I use to try out new Python features with the intent of creating a real live MUD at some point.

As I started this project back in early 2006(ish), I was learning at the time and using examples
to help me through some tough parts so if there are any similiarities to other code I will remove
or modify them as requested.


Python Version: Verified to work on Python 3.3.0a3.  Not verified to work on any other version.
I develop on Windows 7 currently.  You will need to modify world.py to match your OS/setup.
There is also a WingIDE project file in the /src folder if you happen to use Wing. 


Start by running apm.py.  You should then be able to telnet to localhost port 4000.  I
recomend PuTTY as a telnet client as that is the one I use to test with.  Any 'non-windows'
telnet client should work, however I haven't tested many of them.

There is a generic admin character already created:
Username: newadmin
Password: password

I can be reached on http://www.python-forum.org/ (the Game Programming sub). (bwp)

I am also still learning GitHub so please send me a message if you want to discuss commit privs.

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT.  THIS CODE MAY OR MAY NOT WORK IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
