Todo, in mild order or priority:

Figure out the Milestone and Issue tracker features of GitHub.

Document the code base as much as possible.

Determine how I want to store persistant data other than the current flat file.


Develop Milestones/Branches:
	Develop persistant data storage system for:
		Help File Data
		World Configuration
		Topic specific configuration data (Body Parts, Property Values etc)
		Area descriptions and exit information?

	Develop the world more fully:
		Expand on current area system.
		Develop a weather system.
		Flush out ideas on the city/kingdom system.
		Build framework for 'between text area' wilderness area.
		
	Develop Objects:
		?

	Develop Mobiles (Also refered to as NPCs), game controlled characters/beings:
		?

	More to be deiced at this point - Open to ideas to make it more 'theme' generic.
